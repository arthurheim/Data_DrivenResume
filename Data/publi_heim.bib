(2011) which found that attention and behavior problems in childhood (a composite of impulsive hyperactive, inattentive, and impulsive-aggressive behaviors labeled "self-control") predicted adult financial status, health, and criminal activity. Using data from longitudinal cohort studies in the United States (n = 1,168) and the United Kingdom (n = 16,506), we largely reproduced their pattern of findings that attention and behavior problems measured across the course of childhood predicted a range of adult outcomes including educational attainment ({$\beta$}U.S. = -0.22, {$\beta$}U.K. = -0.13) and spending time in jail (ORU.S. = 1.74, ORU.K. = 1.48). We found that associations with outcomes in education, work, and finances diminished in the presence of additional covariates for children's home environment and achievement but associations for other outcomes were more robust. We also found that attention and behavior problems across distinct periods of childhood were associated with adult outcomes. Specific attention and behavior problems showed some differences in predicting outcomes in the U.S. cohort, with attention problems predicting lower educational attainment and hyperactivity/impulsivity predicting ever spending time in jail. Together with the findings from Moffitt et al., our study makes clear that childhood attention and behavior problems are associated with a range of outcomes in adulthood for cohorts born in the 1950s, 1970s, and 1990s across three countries.

  abstract = {Preschool policy is motivated by the notion that early childhood care and education increases school readiness, which, in turn, provides a foundation for lifelong advantages and greater success in adulthood. We question the degree to which this simple skill-building model is an effective framework for preschool policy: while investments in preschool education boost school readiness in the short run, some recent studies show that initial gains either quickly disappear or turn negative. Taking advantage of end-of-preschool gains requires considerable effort toward optimizing classroom learning experiences, integrating the learning goals of preschool and K--12 schooling, and pushing for new discoveries about early-life skills and capacities that preschools are uniquely positioned to target. Supporting parental employment and access to affordable childcare also benefit child development, so we argue that the preschool policy portfolio should include mechanisms that more broadly expand childcare access to support family capacities.}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of a 3-year, monthly unconditional cash transfer on health, nutrition, sleep, and health care utilization among children experiencing poverty who were healthy at birth. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This longitudinal randomized clinical trial recruited 1000 mother-infant dyads between May 2018 and June 2019. Dyads were recruited from postpartum wards in 12 hospitals in 4 US cities: New York, New York; Omaha, Nebraska; New Orleans, Louisiana; and Minneapolis/St Paul, Minnesota. Eligibility criteria included an annual income less than the federal poverty line, legal age for consent, English or Spanish speaking, residing in the state of recruitment, and an infant admitted to the well-baby nursery who will be discharged to the mother's custody. Data analysis was conducted from July 2022 to August 2023. INTERVENTION Mothers were randomly assigned to receive either a high-cash gift (\$333/mo, or \$3996/y) or a low-cash gift (\$20/mo, or \$240/y) for the first several years of their child's life. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary preregistered outcomes reported here include an index of child health and medical care and child sleep disturbances. Secondary preregistered outcomes reported include children's consumption of healthy and unhealthy foods. RESULTS A total of 1000 mother-infant dyads were enrolled, with 400 randomized to the high-cash gift group and 600 to the low-cash gift group. Participants were majority Black (42\%) and Hispanic (41\%); 857 mothers participated in all 3 waves of data collection. We found no statistically detectable differences between the high-cash and low-cash gift groups in maternal assessments of children's health (effect size [ES] range, 0.01-0.08; SE range, 0.02-0.07), sleep (ES range, 0.01-0.10; SE, 0.07), or health care utilization (ES range, 0.01-0.11; SE range, 0.03-0.07). However, mothers in the highcash gift group reported higher child consumption of fresh produce at child age 2 years, the only time point it was measured (ES, 0.17; SE, 0.07; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, unconditional cash transfers to mothers experiencing poverty did not improve reports of their child's health, sleep, or health care utilization. However, stable income support of this magnitude improved toddlers' consumption of fresh}

  author = {Rege, Mari},
  abstract = {The foundations for successful child development are established in early childhood. Two main policy approaches for strengthening these foundations have been subsidized preschool programs and programs targeting the home environment. Our chapter reviews a large body of empirical work investigating whether these programs make a difference for children's development, and if so, how and under what conditions do they help, how cost-effective are they, and which programs are scalable. We start by reviewing studies that estimate how much of the variation in child outcomes can be explained by genetics versus environmental factors. These studies demonstrate that variation in environmental factors plays a key role in explaining individual life outcomes. This suggests that early childhood programs might play a significant role in helping children realize their potential in life. Nevertheless, our review of early childhood programs demonstrates that the evidence is mixed -- some programs are successful in fostering lasting skill development, but many are not. We conclude that existing research on early childhood education falls short of sufficiently answering fundamental questions about what works for whom and why. A tighter link between theory, econometric methods and data is essential to compare and reconcile the mixed and sometimes conflicting empirical results across studies, and to understand when and why the impacts of home environment and pre-school interventions fadeout.}
