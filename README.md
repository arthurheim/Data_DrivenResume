This folder simply contains the code to generate my current resum√© in English.
It uses Rmarkdown and the awesomecv package. The main fields are retrieved from an excel file in the Data folder,
with my experience, publications and so on.

To do something like that on your own: 
1) Plone the entire repository
2) Open an R project in the main folder
3) Open the .Rmd file "AHeimPhD2025" and knit it.
4) customise the xlsx file with your experience and the .Rmd file with your informations

That's it.
